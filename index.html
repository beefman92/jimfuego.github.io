    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      I was born in 1988 in Buffalo, NY. After graduating high school in 2006, I
      enlisted and served four years with the U.S. Marine Corps. After being
      discharged in 2011, I began undergraduate studies at D'Youville College in
      my hometown.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      I was first drawn into psychology and the behavioral sciences. While
      working towards my bachelor's degree I became fascinated with how much
      computers had influenced our understanding of the human brain and mind.
      The social sciences and predictive analytics also contrubuted to my
      interest in fast-moving numbers and big data.

          <p class="card-text">Laps for Limbs is an ability-focused, community organization that raises awareness and funds for local children and veterans with amputations. I jumped on board with Laps for Limbs in 2013 while working on my undergraduate degree. Since then, we have raised  over $70,000 for veterans and children with prosthetic needs. L4L is currently awaiting 501(c)(3) approval from the IRS! We look to expand and go national in the coming years! <a href="http://www.lapsforlimbs.org">Check out our webpage!</a></p>

          <p class="card-text">I was fortunate enough to become good friends with the brain behind Blossom Scholastic while serving my 4 years with the United States Marine Corps. I was given the opportunity to co-found this organization back in 2016 as an initiative to involve more young girls in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Blossom is currently in its 4th year of operation, and we currently run camps at the University of Cincinnati, The Ohio State University, and the University of Buffalo. <a href="http://www.blossomscholastic.org">Check out our webpage!</a></p>

I love what I do, and am looking forward to completing this degree so I can return to my passion, which is education. I look to bring the skills I learn in Silicon Valley back to my homeotwn by both implementing my technical skills in the industry as well as spreading that knowledge to the communtiy through various private education initiatives.</p>
